🚀 Getting started with MVPy
============================
MVPy is a python library that I started to write as part of my PhD, particularly with the aim of making multivariate pattern analysis methods available with built-in GPU support.

To get started, simply install MVPy using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/fabianschneider/mvpy.git

🐣 So what can MVPy do?
=======================
Once you have installed MVPy, you can dive into some of the examples of what you can do:

- `Representational similarity analysis <>`
